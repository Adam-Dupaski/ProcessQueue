# ProcessQueue
This module enables you to control the amount of these microflows that are executed at once by assigning them to queues.  Each of these queues can be configured to handle a subset of these microflows and you can also set a limit to the number of microflows each queue can execute at once. This allows you to control the maximum load put on your application during peak usage by these microflows while still ensuring all microflows will be executed eventually.  The queues use a FIFO approach (first-in, first-out) and will automatically restart themselves (and any microflows still left to execute) after a server restart.
